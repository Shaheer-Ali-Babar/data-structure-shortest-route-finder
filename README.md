Overview
The Shortest Route Finder is a C++ application designed to determine the shortest routes between cities using Dijkstra's algorithm. It also calculates the fuel cost for the journey and provides information on the nearest fuel stations in the source and destination cities.

Features
Efficient Route Calculation: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths between cities.
Comprehensive Network: Includes major cities and their connections with detailed distances.
Fuel Station Information: Displays the nearest fuel stations in both the source and destination cities.
Fuel Cost Estimation: Calculates the total fuel cost for your journey based on distance and fuel type (petrol, diesel, or LPG).
